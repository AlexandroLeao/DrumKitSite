# DrumKitSite

The DrumKitSite project is a web application that simulates a virtual drum kit. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project allows users to click on different visual elements representing drums or press specific keys on the keyboard to play the sounds of different percussion instruments.

The basic structure of the page is built using HTML, using elements such as divs and buttons to visually represent the drum kit. Each visual element is assigned a CSS class for appropriate styling.

The interactivity of the application is implemented in JavaScript. Click events are registered for the visual drum elements so that when an element is clicked, the JavaScript triggers the corresponding sound of the percussion instrument. In addition, event listeners are added to capture the keyboard keys pressed by the user and play the corresponding drum sounds.

JavaScript manipulates the embedded audio elements in the page using HTML <audio> tags. Each drum sound is loaded into a separate <audio> element, and when triggered, JavaScript calls the play() function on the corresponding element to play the sound.

Thus, the DrumKitSite project offers users an interactive experience of playing the drums virtually, either by clicking on the visual drum elements or by pressing the appropriate keys on the keyboard. It is a fun application that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a realistic imitation of a drum kit and provide an interactive musical experience.
